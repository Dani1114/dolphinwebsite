  <h2>How Do Dolphins Communicate? </h2>
  <p>Dolphins intelligently communicate in various ways. They can convey messages and ward off predators. Dolphins socialize and hunt with each other using echolocation from a built-in sonar that bounces sound waves off things and reveals information like their location, size, and shape. Dolphins can make squeaks, buzzes, whistles, clicks, and a wide array of other crazy noises. Breaching is another way of communication when they jump out of the water or slap the water's surface with their tail or bodies. </p>

    <h2>What is a Dolphin Pods?</h2>
  <p>Dolphins are social mammals that interact, swim together, protect each other, and hunt for food as a team. A group of dolphins is called a pod. Pod life is significant in protecting dolphins from predators such as sharks and orcas. Orcas, also known as killer whales, prey on dolphins, technically their own family. </p>
  
 
    <h4>Common Food Dolphins eat:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fish</li>
      <li>Squid</li>
      <li>Custaceans</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>How Do Dolphins Sleep?</h2>
    <p>Dolphins sleep in their pods as well. They must stay close to the water surface to breathe, as they are no fish but mammals with lungs. Therefore, dolphins must swim while sleeping because they have to come up to the surface to breathe.</p>
 
  <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> Dolphins are incredible. They are socially skilled, intelligent, agile, joyful, and playful creatures that share many emotional similarities with humans. There is an impressive range of different species of dolphins, and they all have their own unique identities and characteristics.
